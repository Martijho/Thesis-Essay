%\newline
The greatest appreciations go to my advisor during this work, Associate Professor Kyrre Glette, for all his help with writing, analysis, and brainstorming.
\newline\newline
The warmest thanks also go to family, friends, and passers-by for their patience while subjected to unprovoked impromptu explanations of the inner workings of PathNet and Machine Learning.
\newline\newline
A special mention also of my colleagues, trapped by my side on the fourth floor, making the last years excellent.
