\chapter{Discussion}
Are your results satisfactory? 
Can they be improved? 
Is there a need for improvement? 
Are other approaches worth trying out? 
Will some restriction be lifted? 
Will you save the world with your Nifty Gadget? 

\section{Discussion} 
Discussion of the accuracy and relevance of the results; comparison with other researchers results. 
\subsection{Common errors}
Too far reaching conclusions; guesswork not supported by the data; introduction of a new problem and a discussion around this.  

\section{Conclusion} 
Consequences of the achieved results, for example for new research, theory and applications. 

\subsection{Common errors}
The conclusions are too far reaching with respect to the achieved results; the conclusions do not correspond with the purpose


- Further exploration of PathNets learning properties should be done with a more computational resources. Such a large structure with multiple levels of computationally intensive operations have a higher limitation to hardware than run-of-the-mill Machine Learning does, which already is some of the more hard computationally heavy optimization problems to attempt.
