ps+ss done first because results might dictate future implementations
selection pressure experimentation: meat of thesis

- room for data usage?

    X   Did you actually build it?

    X   How did you test it? 
    X   Why did you test it this way? 
    Are the results satisfactory? 
    X   Why should you (not) test it more? 
    X   What compensations had to be made to interpret the results? 
    Why did you succeed/fail? 
    
    \section{Result} 
    Answers to the forwarded questions by means of the achieved results. 
    \subsection{Common errors}
    The results are not properly connected to the problem; blurry presentation; the results are inter-mixed with discussion.
